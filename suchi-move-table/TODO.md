# Update Oct 7th

1. Nate's code and my code don't line up in our understanding. Nate seems to not
   map start of runs in F to runs in L... he almost does that but not quite.
   We used Nate's code and it kind of worked well so I'm a little confused.

2. work on manual example on paper to see where things exactly go.

3. currently working on move_find_occurences
